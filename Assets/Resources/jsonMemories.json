I wish I could remember. Maybe if I remembered someone saying it, I would be able to believe it. \n I'm in a daze. I can't remember who was there besides mom, Linda, and Peter Grandy. I know more people were there, but I can't remember. It's strange how just a few hours later, I can't remember. \n I remember that everyone was waiting in what was called the \"Family Waiting Area.\" It was a little glassed off area of the normal waiting area. It reminded me of an aquarium. Separated from everyone else and put on display. It wasn't private. Anyone could see in and see us. I remember being annoyed at being put in the \"Family Waiting Area.\" Our family was ripped apart and wasn't our family anymore. I remember wondering what we would become. \n You'd think I'd remember dad showing up or us leaving the hospital. I don't. Nothing felt real, it still doesn't. \n I remember seeing Gracie at the front door, wagging her tail and with a towel in her mouth. Seeing her happy made me cry. I sat with mom on the couch and we watched the computer screen saver for a while. I laughed when that picture of you on our vacation out west came up. The one which is a close up of your face and you have a funny smile and wide eyes. That laugh brought on more tears, remembering that I'll never see your goofy smile outside of pictures. Though I still don't quite believe that I won't."

You picking me up from school; us driving to Wendy's for dinner since mom and dad weren't home; listening to our songs; me giving you half of my fries because they didn't give you any; you falling asleep on the couch; Lindsay and Dana coming over and waking you up; and then you telling me you were heading to Mike's house. \n It seemed like such a normal evening. There were no signs that something bad was going to happen. You always hear in movies that looking back, they should have known something was to happen. I'm trying to find that clue I missed, the one thing which would have prevented this. \n Even when mom came home and said you'd been in a car accident, I didn't take it seriously. My gut told me that you were going to be fine.'"

I've barely noticed the times mom and dad have left to go sort things out for your funeral and wake. \n There's always people here. They bring flowers and food. They say \"I can't understand what you're going through,\" or \"I'm so sorry,\" or \"he's in a better place,\" or one of the other thousand things said in a time like this. I think I've never met a good fifty percent of the people who have shown up. They introduce themselves, but I can't remember who they are a minute later. I just nod my head when they talk and say thank you for coming, though I don't quite understand why I'm thanking them. I think they just want to feel like they've done something supportive. Maybe they have, done something supportive that is, but it hasn't supported me. \n Mom and dad have asked me to pick out what to bury you in. I've been assured that it doesn't have to be a suit. I assumed it would be a suit because that is what people are buried in in movies. Apparently, I have free reign to pick what I want. I want to pick something you'd like, or I guess, would have liked. I'm still adjusting to verb tenses. The past tense feels wrong when I say it. \n I picked your hot pink polo and some khakis. I can picture you wearing it. This outfit could be considered your signature look. I told mom and dad I picked it because it was your favorite. That was only partially true, I also picked it because I never want to see that polo again. I don't want to see it hanging in your closet. Looking at it brings up vivid images of you wearing it. I don't want it around."

We were supposed to be able to take a break for dinner, but we couldn't. It seemed like every person you'd ever met was there. \n I only knew a fraction of these people. You know those times we'd get introduced to one of mom or dad's friends and they'd say \"of course you remember so and so,\" and we'd have to pretend like we knew who they were? It was like that times a hundred. I just acted like I remembered them, gave them a hug, and said thank you. Fortunately, the line being long meant that no one could stop to talk. \n I didn't like hugging strangers, but it was expected. I was also expected to be grateful that they came. It's because of them that we even had a wake. The wake was so people who aren't our family could come say goodbye, at least, that's how it seemed to me. Maybe mom and dad were comforted by all the people who showed up, but I wasn't. I felt uncomfortable the entire time.\n I swear I'm going to get sick of all the stupid cliches people keep saying. If they really don't know what to say, they shouldn't say anything. Why can't someone just say \"this must suck for you\"? Why do they have to keep talking about God's plan, or a better place, or not being able to understand? \n I heard a few new lines from people tonight. \"Your parents are lucky they still have you.\" and \"Your parents really need you to be strong for them.\" Do people even think about what they say before they say it?"

They've lost a child, I've only lost a sibling, in the hierarchy of grief, theirs is greater. At least, that's the message everyone has been sending. \n I wish I could say I remember your burial, I don't. I spent the entire time making sure mom was ok. When she cried, I was there. There were yellow roses on your casket, I thought you would have preferred pink. I don't know who decided on yellow, but pink would have been more you. \n Over a thousand people came to the funeral. Not everyone could fit into the sanctuary, they had to live stream the service in another room. Like the burial, I barely remember the service because I was paying attention to mom the whole time. \n I just remember feeling like the funeral didn't really capture you. Of course no one ever says anything bad at funerals, and not that I thought they should have said anything bad, I just felt as though there was something missing, some element of you that was missing from the entire thing. I don't know if anyone else felt this as well. I've been afraid to ask because I didn't want to upset anyone by suggesting it was bad."

If I hadn't let them in, they wouldn't have woken you, and you would have slept for the rest of the evening instead of going out. \n I'm almost positive that everyone blames themselves in some way. I know mom and dad each blame themselves, but they weren't home, I was. Sometimes I wonder if they blame me. They'd never admit to it, but it's possible that somewhere in their minds, they blame me. I wish I could blame them. I want to be mad because they didn't take your car away or enforce their rules more strictly, but I can't be. \n Accidents are blameless by definition. Your accident was blameless, but I still blame myself for not preventing it. If you had survived, would you blame yourself for getting into an accident? Do you blame me for not preventing it?"

I'm angry that they're able to be happy and enjoy the season. They don't have to watch commercials about families getting together for the holidays and be reminded that their family is missing someone. \n I'm not sure how to refer to our family. Our family included you, but you're not here, so our family doesn't really exist anymore. I don't want to call it a family, because it doesn't feel like one. There's a Reid shaped hole in this formerly complete family. \n I already bought your Christmas gift. It's a set of body wash and cologne in that scent you like. We decided to bury the cologne with you. I kept the body wash. Sometimes I smell it so I can remember what you smelled like. That probably sounds really weird, but it's comforting. \n We also buried your PSP, your Xbox games, and some of your other favorite things with you. I added little Favorite. I still sleep with big Favorite every night, so I like to think that you have little Favorite to comfort you, and that I'm still connected to you in a way. You were also buried with a silver cross necklace. All the women in our family were given the same one as a connection to you. \n Your friends all added stuff to bury with you as well.

I've experienced something that most people my age have never experienced. Most people my age have never experienced the death of an immediate family member. I'm different from them and they can sense it. \n I feel weird around my friends now. I want to talk about you, but I can't. We're not supposed to talk about death, it makes people uncomfortable. I know people grow quiet when I mention you. I know they avoid talking about anything that could relate to you. I know they're trying to protect my feelings, but they're not. Avoiding you does not, it makes me angry. You've become an elephant in every room I enter. Everyone tries to ignore your existence and I just want them to. \n Is this how the rest of my life will be?

Do you know how often people ask \"so do you have any siblings?\" People assume it's a safe question. I never know how to respond. If I say no, that feels like a lie. However, by answering no, I avoid the awkward follow up questions. If I answer yes, I will inevitably be asked your name, age, school/job, etc. Answering these stops conversations. As soon as I mention that you died, people say sorry and very obviously try to change the subject. \n As soon as I get asked if I have siblings, I have to do some quick mental calculations. How well do I know this person? Will I ever see them again? Do I want them knowing something so personal about me? Will it be awkward later if they assume I have no siblings and I accidentally mention you? \n The answers to these questions all influence how I answer their question.

In a way, I thought that that extended to not thinking ill of the dead. \n You weren't responsible for your accident, how could I be mad at you? My anger made no sense. But the thing no one tells you is that it doesn't have to make sense. My feelings don't need to make sense. I'm allowed to feel what I feel whether it's logical or not. I don't need to feel guilty for how I feel. \n I don't have to feel guilty for enjoying things or having fun. I went to a concert the other week and I had a great time, but as soon as I realized I was happy, I felt guilty for being happy. I also thought about how much you would hate that I was at this concert and it made me laugh. \n I was reminded that I didn't die when you died. I'm allowed to live my life. I don't have to feel guilty for being alive while you aren't. It's easy to say all of this, but it's hard to feel it. Sometimes imagining you yelling at me helps. Just having you yell at me that I'm being stupid and of course I have the right to be happy and have fun sometimes. It feels almost like I'm getting your permission."

I know it won't be easy, but I've made it this far. \n I'm kinda impressed with myself. I can withstand more than I ever imagined I could. There isn't really anything else life could throw at me. I'm surviving this, I can survive anything. The important thing is to remember that, to remind myself that I'm strong. For a long time, I hated being called strong. I felt that being strong meant that I had a choice, but I felt that I didn't have a choice. I know now that I did have a choice. I make the choice to stay strong every day I'm alive.

I'll be able to grieve and heal without having to worry about grades and homework on top of that. I've been reminded that I'm not weak for not being able to handle both at the same time. I'm lucky that mom and dad are letting me do this. They're being so understanding and supportive. I know this has been difficult for all of us and I haven't made things easier for them. I've probably made things worse at times. I was just worried that they'd disconnect in a way, or withdraw from parenting.

I'm grateful that we were at least close for the last year of your life, but I regretted that we never had the chance to really be close. I was mourning a relationship we'd never have. I needed to allow myself to feel upset and angry about that. \n I'd also been carrying around guilt over your death. Against logic, I felt responsible for your death.

I didn't know what my role was going to be. I'm still not entirely sure what my role is. \n I always defined myself as your opposite. Who am I now that you aren't here to define myself by? I still don't know who I am without you, but I don't need to know who I am. \n Am I still your little sister now that I'm older than you were when you died? I still think of myself as your little sister, so I must still be your little sister. \n At first I was afraid of not having answers to all of my questions. I wanted something concrete and definite that I could hold onto. Uncertainty is hard for most people to accept, it's even harder to accept when everything is uncertain and you feel like you're rushing down a river and there's no rock or branch to grab to stop from being swept away.
